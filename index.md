## About me

![My profile picture](./images/illu.jpeg)

My name is **Anh** and I'm majoring in *Computer Science* at ~~Sixth~~ Revelle College at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). 

I have a passion for **_designing_** and ***creating*** user-friendly interfaces for web and mobile applications. 

Some of my hobbies are:

- Coding. ([My Favorite Programming Language](#my-favorite-programming-language))
- Listening to music
- Playing video games

## My favorite programming language

I like javascript and learning how to code websites as well. Here is a snippet of code that prints "Hello World" in the modern ES6 syntax:

```javascript
const helloWorld = () => {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

## My Goals

I have a dream of working for FAANG, especially Apple. Here are some of the steps I plan to take to achieve this are:

1. Finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
2. Create a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills
3. Apply for an internship at Apple and impress them with my work
4. Pursue a career as a full-time software engineer
